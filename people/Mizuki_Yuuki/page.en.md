## Description

{/* Translated by Google Translate */}

Mizuki was a very cheerful, optimistic, and non-binary person who cared about their friends. They did not undergo HRT and had no clear gender identity.

After graduating from college, they worked for an e-commerce company and was laid off after the 2022 epidemic in Shanghai. They had a bad relationship with his family and could only live a difficult and independent life.

They and I got acquainted at a dinner party during the National Day holiday. As kigurumi lovers, they and I and other friends participated in Shanghai Halloween, Shanghai-Saudi cultural exchanges, several private shoots, several shoot appointments, etc. Left with gorgeous memories.

The moment the photo was taken, this photo was no longer just photography. I only felt endless condolences and sorrow in my heart.

When they got his first kigurumi head shell in early December, they was very happy and free. On the third day, I asked them to go to Century Park to take a set of outdoor photos for the first time for me.

After this shooting, they organized a children's party and made two rare trips, one to Kuala Lumpur before Christmas and one to Hong Kong after New Year's Day.

Maybe it was financial problems that overwhelmed them, maybe all their wishes had been fulfilled,

According to their closer friends, they had already attempted suicide twice, and although he was persuaded to do so, the third execution was carried out before the scheduled message was sent. Unfortunately, no one knew about it. When I got the exact news, it was already noon the next day—they was burning charcoal in a solitary hut on January 10, 2024, and left us forever.

I regret not taking more photos of her baby. I will never forget their smile and sincere friendship.

I hope you go to a world without pain, hope your future is colorful.
