## Description

Mizuki was a very cheerful, optimistic, and caring non-binary person.

After graduating from college, Mizuki worked for an e-commerce company but was laid off following the 2022 epidemic in Shanghai. They had a strained relationship with their family which led to a difficult, independent life.

I met Mizuki at a dinner party during the National Day holiday. As fellow Kigurumi enthusiasts, Mizuki and I, along with other friends, participated in various events such as the Shanghai Halloween, Shanghai-Saudi cultural exchanges, and several private and scheduled photo shoots, creating splendid memories.

At the moment the photo was taken, it transcended mere photography. My heart was filled with endless mourning and sorrow.

In early December, when Mizuki got their first Kigurumi headpiece, they were overjoyed and felt liberated. Three days later, I invited them for an outdoor photo session in Century Park – my first of such kind.

After this photoshoot, Mizuki organized a doll party and made two rare trips: one to Kuala Lumpur before Christmas and another to Hong Kong after New Year's Day.

Perhaps it was financial troubles that overwhelmed them, or maybe they had fulfilled all their wishes.

According to their close friends, Mizuki had already attempted suicide twice. Although dissuaded before, they carried out their third attempt before the scheduled message could be sent. Regrettably, no one was aware of it. By the time I received the news, it was already noon the next day—Mizuki had passed away on January 10, 2024, leaving us forever.

I regret not taking more photos of them. Their smile and sincere friendship will always be unforgettable.

I hope they have found a world free of pain, a future full of color.
