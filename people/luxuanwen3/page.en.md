## Description

**Nini** is a sweet transgender girl who has a keen interest in computers, experiences some anxiety, and is generally warm and friendly. She was taking medication and exogenous hormones on month-basis. Her avatar was created by the talented artist ディーバ/Deaver (@Deaver1229).

However, her parents had a lot of reservations about transgenderism, so she was closely monitored, and the only sister who can relate to her had difficulty communicating with her due to distance and academic commitments.

Towards the end of July 2024, there was a extreme increase in the conflict between Nini and her parents. Her parents decided to stop her hormone replacement therapy and other medications, and they began to regard her as a rebel against orthodox. This was the first time she had considered taking her own life. After taking a significant amount of drugs and leaving her home, she was fortunate to be found by passersby after collapsing on the street. Subsequently, Nini was unable to access the drugs.

At 11:55 p.m. on August 4, 2024,Nini made the last decision. After posting her final tweet, she took an overdose of chemicals. Her close friends rushed around trying to bring her back. However,at 3 a.m. the next morning, Nini left us to pursue her own path and seek her own freedom.

Nini is very warm to people, though this is not always evident in her outward demeanor. Rather, it is reflected in the pieces of her words that contain her equal and full love for everyone. She may call you "babe" and offer a hug. She will patiently explain what you don't know and try not to pass on her negativity to her friends.

I (@Collapsar_ndn) haven't known Nini for very long, but I'm still affected by her positive energy, and I welcome all the other friends to contribute to the text and reminisce about our former friend,Nini.
Thanks for your help to Nini. @awxs_2081573566 @Bolichara0 @N552AA
