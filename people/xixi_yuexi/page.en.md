Sometimes, she likes to go to the arcade in Xinjiekou[^1] to play maimaiDX a few times.  

> The End ~ 9000 points achieved ~ I feel great today, 9 SSS+, 3 SSS and some small points, totally 99 points!

Other times, she turns on her tablet to obtain ptt[^2] for a while.

This silly girl loves to eat barbecue, sometimes finishing a big plate all by herself.

Sometimes she even turns into a child.

> I caught a doll today, yay!

Loves you.

## Departure

After she took a leave of absence from [Nanjing Agricultural University](https://rle.wiki/campus/NJAU.html) and returning home, her already unsustainable mental state deteriorated further..  

> I can't muster the energy for the hobbies I once loved. What do I have left? Hmm... it seems I still have an interest in delicious food and beautiful clothes. Maybe... I can still save myself (laughs)

In the end, she chose to leave during the supposed joyous summer vacation

> Farewell, YueXi...
