Sometimes, she would like to go to the Arcade that located in Xinjiekou[^1] to play several times of maimaiDX.  

The End ~ 9000 points achieved ~ I feel great today, 9 SSS+, 3 SSS and some small points, totally 99 points!

Or, sometimes I turn on my tablet and obtain ptt a few times.

This little idiot likes to eat barbecue. Sometimes she eats a big plate by herself.

Sometimes she even turns into a child.

> I caught the doll today, yay!

Loves you.

## Depart

After she took a leave of absence from [Nanjing Agricultural University](https://rle.wiki/campus/NJAU.html) and returned home, her already unsustainable mental state collapsed even further.  

> I can no longer take up the hobbies I once had, so what do I have left? Hmm... I seem to be interested in delicious food and beautiful clothes. Maybe... I can still save some (laughing)

In the end, she chose to leave during the supposed joyous summer vacation

> Farewell, YueXi...
