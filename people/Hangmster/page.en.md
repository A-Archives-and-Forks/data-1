Hangmster is an ally of us.

They often interacted with friends at Twitter/X, and they were a barrel of laughs. They would also give warm hugs when we needed, console us when we were in anxiety, and mourn for our departed friends.

Although they seldom mentioned what they loved. However, according to their tweets, they would be attracted by cute things such as little cats. They are fond of Hatsune Miku as well. In the Hatsune Miku 15th anniversary, they expressed their happiness by drawing an illustration:

Hangmster always be troubled by sleeplessness and anxiety. They once said that they actually didn't like their body in reality, and diversified self-personality would make them more comfortable.

Unfortunately, although they always encouraged us to live bravely, but they still chose to leave at the beginng of the year.

Rest well, Hangmster. May you can be yourself as you like.
