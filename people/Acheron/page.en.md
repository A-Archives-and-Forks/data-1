## Description

Acheron was a young trans girl who was lovely, brave, and kind-hearted.

She uploaded several Minecraft gameplay videos on Bilibili.
She once excavated an entire chunk with nine friends from the speedrun community in just 30:17.

Acheron was also knowledgeable in technology.
She uploaded two notable videos:
one unboxing the BearPi-HM Nano development board,
and another on installing Klipper based on Debian 10.

## Departure

Acheron battled depression alone,
never letting it affect others,
and everyone who knew her was fond of her.

Despite an unfortunate childhood and a difficult present,
she didn't complain about her experiences online.
She always faced life's challenges with optimism and positivity.

But she left us so early that we cannot even see her retreating figure.

In an instant, we were forever separated, like heaven and earth apart...
