## Turning point

On May 20, 2023, she met an online friend named lib一抹阳光, who stopped her from committing suicide seven times and helped her survive together with Miss Endercat

## Her death

Because one of her important friends committed suicide, Qianxia also collapsed and swallowed pills to commit suicide. Although she was rescued, the previous suicides had left extremely serious sequelae. This time, a benign brain tumor worsened, which led to Qianxia's death in just a few days. Before she died, she told lib一摸阳光 about her childhood: "I remember when I was very young, I saw a handkerchief with a cute pattern on the table. I liked it very much and went to take it, but my mother opened my hand and said why boys like such feminine things." Chinatsu cried on the phone...

> She said to lib一抹阳光: The time I spent with you was the happiest time of my life in the past 14 years
