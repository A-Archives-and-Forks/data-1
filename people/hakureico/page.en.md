## Description

Chika was a lovely trans girl.

THE iDOLM@STER SHINY COLORS

Nekopara
## Her Departure

由 Mizuki 写下这些文字，这里是 Mizuki。

尽管有些难以说明究竟发生了什么，但这个账号的号主，
已经
在一个不会有人讨厌着她，也不会发生不好的事情的世界里了。
朋友们，是时候睡个好觉了呢，保持微笑，要一直活下去呢。

就如同她曾经的男朋友所说，
“成为了魔鬼，最终堕入地狱。”

“你真是个笨蛋啊。”
“她是我的猎物。”
“为什么不多自杀几次呢？”
她的男朋友说。

许多次以后，
她的朋友有了另一个男朋友，
而他想要她放弃自杀。



Written by mizuki. mizuki here.
Although hard to say
the original owner of this account
has been
in a world
where no people would hate her
and no bad things would happen.
time to sleep friends,
and keep smiling, keep alive.

as her boyfriend said
finally went to hell as devil.

"You are an idiot"
"She is my own prey"
"Why not commit suicide several more times"
her boyfriend said.

after several times
her friend had another boyfriend
and he wanted her to give up

seeking for the end of her first love
but cannot receive an answer
even if the answer is "Go fuck yourself"

她找寻着她第一次爱的尽头，但是没办法得到一个答案，即使答案是“去你的吧！”

they once were a pairing.
but apart as she had a "helper" personality.

他们曾经是一对，
但是分开了，因为她有着“帮助者”的人格

"May the world could treat you well."
"At least better than me."

“希望世界好好对你”
“至少比我好。”

and left a letter for her only friend who has got a boyfriend.

她留下了一封信，给她唯一的朋友（有男朋友）的一封信。

and burnt her belongings.

然后，燃尽了她所携的一切。

drown in the river behind her home.

在居所后方的川流之下离开了。

## 8

:| http://zhihu.com has a so shitty experience on reading comments without being fucked by recommended passages and its following advertisement...btw she told me read comments till 8/16.

知乎的浏览体验真他妈的差劲啊，还有一对推荐消息和什么广告，但是她告诉我要一直看到8月16号的评论。

## 一些其他的

I read about her leftover messages in her chatting software.

我看了她聊天软件之中留下的消息

She was trapped in a triangle of love. :(

她被困在三角恋爱之中

Another thing is that My work has done, including taking care of her accounts.

另外就是，我该做的已经结束了，包括关注她的这些账号。

Now these accounts are free. May she free too.

现在这些账号都将释放，她的灵魂也该释然了。
