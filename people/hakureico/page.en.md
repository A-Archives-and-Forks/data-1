## Description

Hanasaka was a trans girl, who was lively and lovely.
She studied in School of Mathematics, Liaoning Normal University.

She was proficient in mathematics,
and she enjoyed learning computer science.

She was also a traffic-fan.
She had interests on city bus, rail transit and national railways.
Occasionally, she took a plane and looked at the blue sky outside the porthole.

Although those were always solo trips.

She was good at playing music game OSU, and uploaded many videos of her gameplay.
She was still online even if she was in bad mental condition.

Hanasaka was also focus on several kinds of games,
such as *THE iDOLM@STER SHINY COLORS* and *Nekopara*.
Sadly, she gradually lost her interest on game under life pressure,
and she no longer updated her activity on games afterwards.

Although for some reasons, her mental health got worse since March 2018. Luckily, there were still people who cared about her.
In early June 2018, she went to IKEA with an acquaintance of her, and eat tasty and affordable ice cream corns together.

## Her Departure

As Hanasaka described herself on Zhihu profile: "Just a Giftia, about to be destroyed".

A Giftia is a type of android with a humanoid body in anime *PLASTIC MEMORIES*.
They have their own personality and emotion.
But they can only "live" for a maximum of 81,920 hours,
after which their programming becomes corrupted due to numerous failed attempts at overwriting old information.
If a Giftia is not retrieved and deactivated before the end of their lifespan, it is very likely that they will become "Wanderers". 

Hanasaka used this metaphor to describe her mental state about to collapse.

In May, she use "Mayday" to convey the signal that she was approaching her limit.
Fortunately, she was out of danger late on.

Although she told everyone to go out and take a look at the scenery to relax,
and she also said "Please keep alive even if you are desperate. In that case, you can make dreams come true."

But she still chose to leave this world in August.

Before that, she entrusted Mizuki, a railfan in United States to announce her death on her account.

Mizuki told us a short story instead of publishing a cold obituary.

> Finally went to hell as a devil.
> 
> updated 18-08-09

The sentence was left by her boyfriend to her.
She was seeking for the end of her first love, but she cannot receive an answer.
even if the answer is "Go f*ck yourself"

Finally, she could only leave such words:

> "May the world could treat you well."
> 
> "At least better than me."

In fact, how could she possibly be a devil going to hell?
She was a gentle person with a "helper" personality.
She always thought about others without considering herself.
But perhaps it's also the reason why they aparted.

At last, she burnt her belongings, and drown in the river that never stopped flowing.

She had been in a world where no people would hate her, and no bad things would happen.

## Her Letter

Hanasaka left a letter for her only friend:
