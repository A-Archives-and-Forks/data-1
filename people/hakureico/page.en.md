## Her Departure

由 Mizuki 写下这些文字，这里是 Mizuki。

Written by mizuki. mizuki here.
Although hard to say
the original owner of this account
has been
in a world
where no people would hate her
and no bad things would happen.
time to sleep friends,
and keep smiling, keep alive.

as her boyfriend said
finally went to hell as devil.

"You are an idiot"
"She is my own prey"
"Why not commit suicide several more times"
her boyfriend said.

after several times
her friend had another boyfriend
and he wanted her to give up

eeking for the end of her first love
but cannot receive an answer
even if the answer is "Go fuck yourself"

they once were a pairing.
but apart as she had a "helper" personality.

"May the world could treat you well."
"At least better than me."

and left a letter for her only friend who has got a boyfriend.

and burnt her belongings.

drown in the river behind her home.

:| http://zhihu.com has a so shitty experience on reading comments without being fucked by recommended passages and its following advertisement...btw she told me read comments till 8/16.

Some Extra/

I read about her leftover messages in her chatting software.

She was trapped in a triangle of love. :(

Another thing is that My work has done, including taking care of her accounts.

Now these accounts are free. May she free too.
