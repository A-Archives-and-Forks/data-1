## Description

Mushroom was a trans girl who made efforts to live.

She shared her daily life on social media,
sometimes posting photos of herself.
Her answers in Zhihu questions also included her shared content and photos.

Her favourite dessert was sweet strawberry sundae,
and she also enjoyed drinking canned iced cola.

In order to support herself,
she attended an interview to become a network anchor for MOMO,
and she achieved a significant milestone initially.
The female colleagues at her company understood her transgender identity and challenges.
They encouraged her to be herself and move forward,
one of them invited her to be a guest at home.

When she was tired, she would also treat herself with food and drinks.

Her father was gradually in favour of her,
and she started looking forward to completing SRS.

Mushroom had a girlfriend.
They met on February 11th, 2017, and accompanied each other for several months.
They once watched the scenery of Shenzhen Fisherman Wharf and many exciting movies,
they also enjoyed endless delicious food.

## Her Departure

Mushroom was struggling with depression,
and she needed to take several kinds of medicine.

"The doctor said to me that if I took medicine regularly, everything would go well."

"In fact, I don't want to kill myself. I always endeavour to live."

……

Before she departed, she smiled sweetly at everyone.

## After Her Departure

Mushroom once excerpted a passage from Shen Nanxi's answer in Zhihu question [What are your favourite sentences orpersonal status?](https://www.zhihu.com/question/36442613/answer/207763687) as a reflection to herself.

> There is only one hell in this world,
> 
> which is the world we live in now.
>
> You may think you are so kind because you are a fallen angel,
> 
> but actually you are just the weakest amidst the devils.

After Mushroom's departure, Shen Nanxi wrote a [memorial essay](https://archive.md/hQ7AS) for her to express her mourning.

> At last, I wish you well.
>
> We will finally meet again,
>
> in that distant and warm world.

Goodnight, Mushroom. May you be a happy mushroom in another world🍄
