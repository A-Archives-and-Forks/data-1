The moment she opened her eyes, a fantasy world bloomed for her.

The starry sky has sent this daughter of the sky, and she is willing to become an earthly companion from now on.

The morning sun lit up a ray of morning light, and then turned into her two wings.

Clouds and clouds dimmed the scenery for a day, and then quietly left behind her colorful clothes.

The Big Dipper is long and narrow, turning into a twinkling tassel

The stream twists and turns, turning into a lively musical note

The flawless girl walks through the crowd, catching all the splendor in her eyes

However, under the cloudy day and night on the surface, what is hidden is the darkness

When the sun shining on the earth has dispersed,

When the gentle, bright and quiet moon drifts away,

At this moment when there is no time to take care of her

She stroked the ice-cold rock,

The light is far away from her at this moment, but if there is light in the soul, it will be illuminated

Life is far away from her now, but the seeds will sprout in spring

At this moment, thorns surround her, but the greenery will spread when we meet again

When the warm sun leaves the distant horizon and shines on the cold and hard rocks,

She was frozen by the cold, hoping that the spring light could penetrate the darkness,

There is hope burning deep in my heart, expecting the seeds to break through the ground and sprout,

Even if the road is full of thorns, she still firmly believes that the soft green will eventually spread.

It wasn't until the end that we discovered that the light in her world was only the size of a candle.

But what she wrote to us is a bright light

Occasionally inspiration strikes, and after careful consideration, I leave a neat rhythm.

On weekdays, she also writes down her thoughts or participates in popular literature. "Life of Aiden" (or "Aiden's Life of Fantasy") is one of her co-creations with her friends.

Either witnessing her passion for writing or feeling the resonance behind her words, several friends were influenced by her and started writing one after another.

In her spare time from work, she also studies AI graphics. Not only did she use Stable Diffusion to generate a channel avatar, she also created several 2023 Mid-Autumn Festival greeting cards (Illustration: Greeting Cards).

## The final chapter

> さようなら~
>
> By the time I read this letter, I should have been in everyone’s memory.
>
> From the moment we met, time really flew by. And next, everyone will have to spend a time that I don’t know.
>
> What will everyone do in the future? Will it continue to be the same as now? But we are all extremely ordinary people, and we may one day be squeezed out or bullied by others...
>
> But I believe everyone can do well no matter where they are.
>
> I want everyone to live happily, but I also know that I may not be able to realize my dream in this life. But I feel very happy to hear everyone's thank you and see everyone's endless discussion. I am proud of myself for being able to work with you all so much and get to know so many great people.
