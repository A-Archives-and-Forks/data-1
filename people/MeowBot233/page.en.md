## Dream of a Dreamlike Girl

A girl was afflicted by a terminal illness.

In the hospital walls, she was confined to her bed each night.

Yet within her slumber,

She would have wondrous dreams every night.

In the realm of her dreams,

She wandered with her beloved, in myriad scenes.

From twilight's embrace till dawn's arrival,

She would dream of that——

Her beloved was awaiting at the hospital gates.

Every evening, hand in hand.

Together they would wander, 

and explore countless enchanting experiences.

As nightfall descended,

the girl fell into the dream swiftly.

then she together with her beloved,

kissed and hugged each other.

went through shops,

played games,

and she found solace in her beloved's embrace...

Later, in their conversations,

she noticed something out of the ordinary:

Her beloved appeared exhausted during the day.

Once, she came out to play with her beloved at night in her dream.

Her beloved bought a pendant.

Later, during their video call,

She noticed the same pendant,

it had never appeared before.

The girl shared her dream tales,

her beloved seemed to have lived them.
 
One day, she realized,

The dreams every night weren't mere fantasies,

but out-of-body experience.

Her soul intertwined with her beloved's.

Making every dream a reality.

After that, the girl fled the hospital,

and reunited with her beloved.

They found happiness for a short time.

Until her health declined.

and she passed away in the arms of her beloved.

Yet her soul lingered.

Bound eternally with her beloved.

## Outside the Story

There is a catgirl, brave and lovely.

An angel she is.

She loves tiramisu most, 

the kind of food combined the sweetness of milk and the bitterness of coffee.

and other sweet.

She has most-loving...

From the end of 2021, to the fall of 2023. More long-lasting may be.

There was a romantic, lovely story.

These stories -- you may have listened to -- would commemorated by us: sad fragments of the past.

People always sigh with feeling:

The fragile one, brilliant "life".

but...

> Indulging in fantasy will not come true after all, and the deceased will not come back. The wish must be realized by the living.
>
> Comfort, is this. Maybe.

Unreliable fatigue, if you feel, or, have no ability to complete the road ahead -- that's no matter.

It's not necessary to make too much effort. 

Dry your tears, a sufficient relax is what you need.

Soothing scenes are everywhere, 

no matter spring, summer, autumn or winter.

Moreover, 

Only love lasts forever.

The storytelling has come to an end.

May you be happy every day.
