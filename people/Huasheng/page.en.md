## In Memory of Miss Huasheng

Miss Huasheng has passed away. I will never see her again.

Only one meeting — just one — and it became forever.
Why? Why can I never see Huasheng again? I hate you, Changhe. You killed her.

The cause of Huasheng's death traces back to her ex, Changhe, who, after years of severe drug abuse, developed hallucinations.
Following a two-hour argument with Huasheng, fueled by uncontrollable emotions, Huasheng broke down and took her own life.
In my view, this was not suicide, but a murder — murder by invisible, venomous words, and a rope spun from malicious cruelty.

Huasheng was a good girl, incredibly gentle.
I first met her at the end of last November in Amoy(Xiamen). The climate there was still warm, and her face carried the rosy glow of a seaside city. 
I stayed at her home that night. She treated me and my friends to a Japanese restaurant, and in the evening, she thoughtfully laid out a mattress and quilt for me, asking if I felt cold.
I will remember it for the rest of my life. I love you, Huasheng — your gentleness, your kindness, your warmth.

Huasheng was very hospitable. That afternoon, she came to pick us up at Xiamenbei Railway Station and thoughtfully bought me a one-way ticket of AMTR, though I had an NFC-enabled transportation card.
So, that ticket — now a vessel of memories — was left with me.

In *In Search of Lost Time*, Marcel Proust showed how a taste of a madeleine could transcend time, turning past experiences into something we truly possess, escaping the bounds of time and achieving a kind of eternal moment.
Now, when I pull out that ticket again from its box, the beautiful memories Huasheng left me seem to permeate everywhere, at every moment.

At that time, her partner was Changhe — the same Changhe who ultimately killed her.

Changhe was a deeply unstable child, whose parents divorced during his early years. He dropped out of middle school and washed dishes in Songyuan, Jilin. 
He became involved in numerous bizarre subcultures, labeling himself as everything from a "Desperate Drug Chemist", a "Dark Web Kingpin", a "pharmacology godfather," a "Narcotics Overlord", a "Malicious Doxing Master" to someone connected with arms dealers in the Philippines. 
(Of course, I question the truthfulness of much of what he claimed.)

From fragments of Huasheng’s conversations with friends, it seems she sympathized with his tragic background.
She even used her savings from working in Shanghai to bring him to Amoy.
Changhe was extremely controlling; whenever any friend tried to distance themselves, he would resort to threats and emotional manipulation.

That night, after dinner, we encountered a stray tabby cat near the apartment.
Changhe became obsessed with the cat and insisted on adopting it.
But Huasheng didn’t like stray cats and wasn’t able to care for one.
Yet absurdly, we spent half an hour downstairs watching him play with the cat.
Changhe demanded that Huasheng buy cat food. Unable to dissuade him, I accompanied her to search for the nearest pet store on Meituan, walking a long two-kilometer stretch along Boyuan Road.
We talked the whole way. That memory of Huasheng is engraved forever in my heart.

Perhaps the conflict began then.
Perhaps it had been brewing longer. Either way, Huasheng and Changhe clashed often after that, many arguments centering around the cat.
During the Lunar New Year, she returned to Nantong, and Changhe went back to Songyuan. Later, Changhe became infatuated with a trans girl battling cancer, borrowing money from various friends to send to them. Even Huasheng had lent him money.
Around this time, a friend advised her to leave Changhe behind and start anew.

On the early morning of April 1st,Huasheng unlinked her QQ Couple Space account from Changhe.
That triggered a storm of threats from him. He first doxxed her family’s address, then messaged her:

>"Bind our couple account back together. Being with me is your only choice."
>
>"Your family can’t run. I’ll fly to Qidong tomorrow, pour gasoline at your door, burn your whole family alive, and stab you to death."
>
>"I'll come find your parents. Since you love living with them so much, you can all go to hell together."

Later, she told a friend,
"He's coming, I need to run."
She also told colleagues on WeChat that someone was trying to kill her and that she was planning to flee. 
After two hours of argument that afternoon, she left a final message: "I can’t take it anymore."
And within just over an hour, she lost contact with everyone.

Huasheng’s close friend Wangmao traveled over 1,400 kilometers immediately upon hearing the news, 
hurrying to Nantong to provide supplemental information to the family and police — otherwise, Huasheng's death might have gone undocumented.
I want to emphasize again: this was murder. The violence and terror of language stole Huasheng’s young life.

The most absurd thing is that before killing his ex, Changhe said: "Huasheng, your parents can't escape." After killing her, he said: "I love Huasheng, I want her belongings." But when asked about responsibility, he shamelessly claimed: "Her death has nothing to do with me."

She is gone now. And what can I do?
The unbearable lightness of being.

Life, like composing a symphony, weaves random events into a central theme under the guidance of beauty, recording it into the music of our existence. As a composer shapes a sonata, life’s theme repeats, evolves, deepens. Anna could have ended her life in many ways, but it was the station, the unforgettable theme of death combined with the awakening of love, that lured her at her most desperate moment, with tragic beauty.
Thus we compose our lives according to the laws of beauty — even into despair — without ever knowing it.

## To the Eternal Star

A Letter to My Dearest Friend, Miss Huasheng:

The spring wind brushes past the branches again,
but it can no longer softly call your name.

The world remains noisy after your departure,
only missing the gentle warmth that belonged to you alone.

I remember the light in your eyes when you smiled,
like fireflies on a midsummer’s night.

I remember the slight curve of your lips when you spoke,
as if suffering had never beaten you down.

I remember you always saying,
"Tomorrow will be better,"
like a flower eternally reaching toward the sun.

Now you have become the breeze among the clouds, the stars in the night sky,
or perhaps the white butterfly fluttering past my window at dawn.

I continue to collect all the beautiful moments in this world,
watching more sunsets, breathing in more flowers — for you.

If karma truly governs rebirth,
may you never have to be so strong again.

If heaven truly exists,
may it be filled with the poetry and moonlight you loved.

This meeting was too short;
this parting, too long.

Wangmao, written in tears, April 2, 2025
