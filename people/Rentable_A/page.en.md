Thought a lot  
From begin to end, I always alone. I want to seek light, but the darkness completely turns me into a lunatic. Sooner or later, I will fall into the abyss of darkness...  
Nothing. This is the end.  

## Description

Has someone she cares about  

> The brain is like a ball of paste wrapped up  
> I can’t remember clearly what happened more than ten seconds ago  
> That's it...good night  

After [YanTian](https://one-among.us/profile/SS3B_0016) passed away, she tried to leave this world by cutting her wrists.  

> That feeling of being stripped away bit by bit
> Watching myself encounter another self in the hallucination  

## Depart

After [SANYIA](http://www.sanyia.top) [entered the mental health hospital again](https://meow.sanyia.top/index.php/archives/357/), Rentable burned out her last breath of hope.  

> Who is homeless and sitting on the street crying at three o'clock?  
> It turns out to be me...  

SANYIA once told her that she would be discharged from the hospital in July, and this became the last straw for her.  
She finally chose to leave at the beginning of the rainy season  

Hope you are well in another world
