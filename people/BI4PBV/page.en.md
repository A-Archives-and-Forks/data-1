## Farewell

> Greenland-1 balloon officially lost contact at 17:52:56 last night

> Greenland-1, codenamed SS1TP, was released at 17:43:13 on May 6. It carried an experimental amateur radio payload. However, due to the low antenna, power and flight altitude, the balloon was released at 9 minutes and 43 seconds. Loss of signal after seconds.
