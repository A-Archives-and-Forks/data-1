In the two Zhihu questions [How's meeting Xuewulihuameng irl?](https://www.zhihu.com/question/269853559) and [How to appraise the death-seeking behavior of Xuewulihuameng?](https://www.zhihu.com/question/268738337), many of her friends expressed their grief and said that she was really gentle. Even just before her departure, she still consoled and encouraged one of her friends.

## Her Departure

As mentioned at the beginning, "May kind souls be treated gently by the world."

But, Xueli herself was a kind, gentle girl...

On the afternoon and evening of April 1st, 2018, she was still living happily in this world.

However, later on,
after failing to reveal her gender identity to her parents and browsing numerous negative messages on the internet,
she started to consider the idea of taking her own life.

On that quiet night, she left home for the Huanghuayuan Jialingjiang Bridge...

This is the last photo she left behind:

Looking into the distance from the bridge,
the blurred lights seemed to be moistened by tears...

After leaving a scheduled suicide note, Xueli chose to leave this world.
She wore a beautiful dress,
and there was still a sweet smile on her face when she was found.

Her friend said that she was afraid of pain undoubtly.
She always treated people around her gently,
but what she'd done was so cruel to herself...

## After Her Deperture

Xueli's friend [Futajuhuacha](https://one-among.us/profile/Futajuhuacha) was also a very gentle girl.

After her left, Huacha deeply missed her and eventually chose to follow her to death in the same place.

Pray for these two girls in heaven.

"As if the vernal breeze had come back overnight, Adorning thousands of pear trees with blossoms white."

We are waiting for the day gentle breeze comes again,
and pear blossoms come out once more,
also waiting for your return, reunion...
