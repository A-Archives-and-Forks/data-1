## Description

Sugar is a girl from Chongqing. 
She entered a university in Hangzhou, Zhejiang in the autumn of 2023.

Sugar was introverted, and she always cared about others' thoughts.
She was too shy to express her confusion and anxiety. Morever, she had't a friend to confide her thought, she could only hide these in heart. That made her look a bit intimidated.

She even prepared a lot before she met friends in real life. She was too worried about making a bad impression on her friends, so she asked them a series of problems in advance (such as the kind of gift they hope to receive), and announced that she might show regressive behavior.

She has a not-so-good family. Her father worked in railway group and her mother taught in school. She didn't feel love from her family.
When she was in senior high school, she hided her dress at home, but they were still confiscated by her family at last.
This incident made her deeply convinced that her parents were extremely conservative and unable to communicate.

## The dissipated haze in Hangzhou

One 6th Janurary 2024, Sugar met a friend (Temporarily call her A) in Hangzhou.

Before she met A, she hided in restroom and was always looking herself in the mirror.
she thought she was not qualified to meet people and was too timid to come out.
But to be honest, althought she hadn't grown her hair and worn her favourite clothes, she was still cute and pretty.

The two girls visited many landscapes in Hangzhou……

West Lake Culture Square, Wulin Suqare, Wuliu Lane, and Fengshan Gate.

在最后临别时，她问了 A 关于「要挟」的看法，吐露了心声：

>（以下内容根据友人记忆复述，并非原文）：
>
> 「或许我要做的事情就是要挟，既然他们完全无法沟通…
> 
> 我让自己受一点伤……但是我怕疼……
>
> 换取一些空间……他们总归会让步的吧……
>
> …………
>
> 根据计划，今天结束见面之后我就会删你好友了。
>
> 让你担心不好，你早点忘记我吧。」

下车时，A 把还没吃完的半兜橘子扔给她，在 QQ 私信里留了一句「Adios.」[^1]。却没有得到回复。当晚她确实删掉了好友，推特也屏蔽了 A。

次日，一个自称其高中同学的推特用户代她捎来了几句碎碎念，A 说让这位同学多关注一下她。

后来，她放了寒假，去深圳康宁开了证——这是 A 事后才晓得的。

## The very thick fog over Jialing River

1 月 22 日，她回到重庆，并且恢复了与 A 的联系。

（据当时在外地的母亲事后称，微信聊天里那时她刚回重庆似乎很开心。）

但实际上并没有。

她在当晚实施计划前联系了A，她和 A 反复确认表示，本次目的并非自杀，是创造自杀未遂的记录，以此表现对跨性别诉求的刚需，达到令父母让步的目的。

可她决定服用的剂量超致死量。

A 和别的推友劝不住，只能退而求其次为她兜底（服药后尽快报 120 ），因为 A 没有报警条件，包括沟通困难，住址信息模糊等等，救护车在半个小时多后才开出。

糖被送至渝北区第二人民医院时已生命垂危，于当夜（1 月 23 日凌晨）中毒身亡。

## After her departure

糖的母亲在 23 日早辗转联系到 A。

在A将糖的性别焦虑情况以及并非他杀等告知对方时，她表现出了闻所未闻的惊讶：

> 「他(sic.)从来没有跟我们说过这些事！怎么突然就这样子去……」
>
> （糖似乎确实完全没有正面沟通过这件事。）

丧女的冲击太大，她也说出了「这么自私不考虑我们怎么办」之类的话，并想要解锁孩子的手机。

A 向糖的母亲表示如果可以希望将糖作为女儿下葬，但她是[这样](https://twitter.com/KiraRettosei/status/1749728762261012752?s=20)回复的。（链接可能含有触发要素，请谨慎点击）

不过，她的态度也在慢慢变化。

糖的父母开始收拾她的遗物。

糖的母亲问 A 是否想要她生前爱抱的宜家鲨鲨。

她说：「他是我们的天使，可惜老天爷让他早走他不得不走。」

糖的母亲一直很感谢 A。

## The new spring

12th, February 2024. The third day of Spring Festival.

At this night, A set off for a trip to Guiyang and Chongqing.

In Ningbo Lishe International Airport,

A sat on the seat near the porthole, and wait for the launch of the plane.

In a daze, a phone call from Chongqing came, and she was familiar with the number.

>（The words in brackets represent A.）
>
> My kid, how are you now?（I am fine, what happened? ）
>
> It's nothing, but…… I always worried about that you might……as well. So I'm calling to ask you are okay or not.
> 
> My kid, if anything happened in the future, please tell your parents and not hold it in your stomach. Your parents always love you.
> 
> After our generation became parents, we no longer keep the authority and stubbornness of our elders.
> 
> So do I…… The path I am currently taking in life is not what my parents hoped, but I think it's no problem.
>
> We may not fully understand the decisions made by children.
> but we will support her if she carefully considered.
> 
> My kid, I am glad you're okay, wish you a happy life.

Sugar had a very cute face and figure.
If we change a character of her name to another homophonic one, it would became a girl's name that perfectly matches her gentle and soft temperament.

But she just departed like this, with a mentality of "take a gamble".
Her life was frozen at the age of 19.

When Sugar just passed away, her mother couldn't accept her behavior. But what about her mother said at last?

Anyway, she had passed away.

> Hope you remembers sugar.
> 
> Hope you can share important information, such as your address, with trustworthy friends to avoid any unexpected situations.
> 
> Hope that if you see a help request message, don't just swipe.
> 
> Hope that if you have the ability to call the police, you can dial decisively. You are a lifesaver, not a murderer. Don't be afraid.
> 
> Hope you cherishes life, hope still exists; you will only miss the opportunity if you leave too early.
> 
> Hope you remembers sugar……

Take care.
