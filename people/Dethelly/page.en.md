## Description

Sugar was a girl from Chongqing. 
She entered a university in Hangzhou, Zhejiang in the autumn of 2023.

Sugar was introverted, and she always cared about others' thoughts.
She was too shy to express her confusion and anxiety.
Moreover, she hadn't a friend to confide her thought, she could only hide these in heart. 
That made her look a bit intimidated.

She even prepared a lot before she met friends in real life. 
She was too worried about making a bad impression on her friends, so she asked them a series of problems in advance (such as the kind of gift they hope to receive), and announced that she might show regressive behavior.

She has a not-so-good family. Her father worked in railway group and her mother taught in school. She didn't feel love from her family.
When she was in senior high school, she hided her dress at home, but they were still confiscated by her family at last.
This incident made her deeply convinced that her parents were extremely conservative and unable to communicate.

## The dissipated haze in Hangzhou

One 6th January 2024, Sugar met a friend (Temporarily call her A) in Hangzhou.

Before she met A, she hided in restroom and was always looking herself in the mirror.
She thought she was not qualified to meet people and was too timid to come out.
But to be honest, although she hadn't grown her hair and worn her favourite clothes, she was still cute and pretty.

The two girls visited many landscapes in Hangzhou……

West Lake Culture Square, Wulin Suqare, Wuliu Lane, and Fengshan Gate.

She asked A about the word "threaten" and confided her voice to A at parting.

> *The following content is based on the memory of her friend, there may be differences from the original text.*
>
> Since they are unable to communicate with……
> 
> Perhaps what I should do is to 'threaten'.
> 
> I should hurt myself a bit, but I am afraid of pain……
>
> Thereby getting more space in turn…… they would make a concession eventually……
>
> ……
>
> According to my plan, I will delete you from my friend list after our meeting.
>
> It's my fault to make you worried about me. Please forget me as soon as possible.

While getting off, A reserved half a bag of oranges for her, and left "Adios."[^1] by QQ private message.
But A didn't get any reply at last, and Sugar actually deleted her at that night.

The second day, a user who claimed to be Sugar's classmate at high school brought her some pieces of thought on behalf of Suger.
Then A requested them to take more care of her.

Later, Sugar began her winter vacation, and got her diagnosis certificate in Shenzhen Kangning Hospital —— This was only known by A afterward.

## The very thick fog over Jialing River

On 22nd January, she returned home in Chongqing, and recovered contact with A.

(Afterward, According to her mother who worked far away from Chongqing, when she just returned home, she looked happy in Wechat chatting.)

But the fact is, actually not.

She contacted with A before she initiated her plan.
A confirmed with her again and again, but she only said that her purpose is not suicide.
The aim of the plan is to express her transgender appeal and persuade her parents by creating a record of attempted suicide.

But the dosage she took exceeded the fatal dose.

A and other Twitter followers of her couldn't persuade her, so they called for the first aid to protect her for the second-best.
Because of difficult communication and ambiguous position, the ambulance only left for rescue half an hour later.

Unfortunatelly, Sugar was dying after she was sent to the Second People's Hospital of Yubei District of Chongqing.
And she passed away in the early morning of the next day due to chemical poisoning.

## After her departure

Later, through a variety of ways, the mother of Sugar contacted with A on the morning of 23rd Janurary.

After A told her about Sugar's gender dysphoria and the fact of suicide, she was astonished by these, and said:

> "He(sic. The same below) had never told us about this! Why he abruptly did……"
>
> (It looked like that Sugar had actually not communicated positively with her parents.)

The lost of kid overwhelmed her, and she even said that Sugar was too selfish and she didn't concerned about them. Then she wanted to unlocked the phone of her kid.

A requested to her that if she can bury Sugar as her daughter, but her mother replied [as this](https://twitter.com/KiraRettosei/status/1749728762261012752?s=20).

However, her mother's attitude was changing gradually.

Her parents started to tidy up her belongings.

Her mother asked A if she wanted to keep Sugar's IKEA Blåhaj Shark, which she loved to hug during her lifetime.

Her mother said, he was their angel, but unfortunately God made him leave early and he had to leave.

Her mother had always been grateful to A.

## The new spring

It's 12th, February 2024. The third day of Spring Festival.

At this night, A set off for a trip to Guiyang and Chongqing.

In Ningbo Lishe International Airport,

A sat on the seat near the porthole, and waited for the launch of the plane.

In a daze, a phone call from Chongqing came, and she was familiar with the number.

>（*The words in brackets represent A.*）
>
> My kid, how are you now?（I am fine, what happened? ）
>
> It's nothing, but…… I always worried about that you might……as well. So I'm calling to ask you are okay or not.
> 
> My kid, if anything happened in the future, please tell your parents and not hold it in your stomach. Your parents always love you.
> 
> After our generation became parents, we no longer keep the authority and stubbornness of our elders.
> 
> So do I…… The path I am currently taking in life is not what my parents hoped, but I think it's no problem.
>
> We may not fully understand the decisions made by children, but we will support her if she carefully considered.
> 
> My kid, I am glad you're okay, wish you a happy life.

Sugar had a very cute face and figure.
If we change a character of her name to another homophonic one, it would became a girl's name that perfectly matches her gentle and soft temperament.

But she just departed, with a mentality of "take a gamble".
Her life was frozen at the age of 19.

When Sugar just passed away, her mother couldn't accept her behavior. But what about her mother said at last?

Anyway, she had passed away.

> Hope you remembers sugar.
> 
> Hope you can share important information, such as your address, with trustworthy friends to avoid any unexpected situations.
> 
> Hope that if you see a help request message, don't just swipe.
> 
> Hope that if you have the ability to call the police, you can dial decisively. You are a lifesaver, not a murderer. Don't be afraid.
> 
> Hope you cherishes life, hope still exists; you will only miss the opportunity if you leave too early.
> 
> Hope you remembers sugar……

Take care.
