## Description

Her name is [keyword233](https://twitter.com/keyword233). She is a transgender female from China. She runned her own channel on Telegram sharing her bits of life and feelings from the heart.

She was a strong and resilient person who bravely faced societal prejudice and discrimination, firmly defended her gender identity. She had a strong interest in computers and cats, which I thought was great. With her intelligence and passion, she added a bright color to this world.

Sadly, she passed away in the hospital on April 19, 2023. We express our deepest condolences and will always remember her.
