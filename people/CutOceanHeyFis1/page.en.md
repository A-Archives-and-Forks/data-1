## Description

Sis Cuddly is a somewhat mysterious girl. Although she often posts some incomprehensible things on Twitter, she is actually a very interesting, cute, and empathetic person.  

Perhaps due to borderline personality disorder or a learning disability, she always likes to add "Cuddle?" at the end of a sentence or a paragraph.  
Because of this, everyone always likes to call her "Sis Cuddly"

She has a peculiar habit of saying, "Cut myself into little pieces and toss them into the sea to feed the fishies..."

She always wanted to explore ways to commit suicide, but, ironically, she died in a artificial accident.

## Departure

In early July 2023, she, who had always been updated every day, suddenly lost her message. Soon after, news emerged that she had been arrested for an alleged negligent homicide, and all contact was lost.

We have no way of knowing the exact date of her death. All we can do is keep her in our memories.

> "Thank you, Sis Cuddly. Don't forget to come and spar with us often in the future."

"Hurry and come cut the watermelon, you can slice it into little pieces! 🍉"
