## Description

Proselyte was our ally. They often interacted with us friendly despite their introverted personality.

They were fond of cute cats. Whether it was their own cat, or cats in a pet shop, or cats they met on the street.

They liked some niche pixel art RPG games, such as *Ib* and *Yume 2kki*, and always recorded their RPG game experiences on Bilibili.

Proseleyte also contributed to their favourite games.
According to their friends, they made soundtracks for some games and took up a position in *Yume Nikki Online Project* before.

## Departure

Owing to long-term domestic violence, having been hurt by a friend in senior high school, and getting mentally abused by their professor in university, Proselyte was troubled by anxiety and depression all along.
They gradually felt that they were losing their sense of existence.

However, they still tried to support themselves by consuming beautiful things, including their favourite games, cute animals, and colourful illustrations.
When our friends fell in anxiety, they would generously give their warm hug.

Until early November, they still held on to the hope of curing depression before their birthday. 
Accidentally, their former friend abruptly said that they harassed him, and blocked them with other people.
They even didn't know what happened, and had no chance to clarify.

> "I felt malice in the world again. I even didn't understand why... Perhaps I was born to be hated."

This thing triggered their PTSD about offence and cold violence from others previously.
After that, their mental health gradually deteriorated.
In the evening, they went out of their home silently and assimilated into the night.

## After their leaving

Owing to their introverted personality, they still had some unsent words to their best friends. 
After Proselyte's departure, a friend of them (who didn't want to disclose their identity) took over their account and sent those words in their name.
The friend also replied to those caring messages in Discord, Twitter/X, QQ platform and so on.

The sister of Proselyte contacted with us as well. Although she couldn't see the last time of them. But she expressed her condolence in her email to us:

> " They are the other half scattered soul of mine. Wish they be well in paradise. I hope there's no autism in heaven. "

"Death is not the end of life, but oblivion is."
Proselyte wrote this for [Qi](https://one-among.us/profile/qiqi233345) to remember her.
This is also a quote sentence shown on the main page of "One Among Us". We will never forget you, who are gentle and tough. Rest well, Proselyte.
