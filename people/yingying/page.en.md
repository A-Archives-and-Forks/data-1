Yingying is a transfemale who has undergone sex reassignment surgery(SRS). She is a lively and cheerful girl who is engaged in digital and chemistry. She looks very handsome when she rides a bicycle. She always bring a good atmosphere to those around her. There is a toothpaste box marked with the Intel Logo at her home. She said that every time people enter her bathroom, the box makes them laugh. <sub>[1]</sub>

In her personal Bilibili account and the hardcore video Bilibili account Geek Lab, she has published a lot of articles and videos about digital devices. In addition, she has posted some videos related to motorcycle riding. She also opened a store on Taobao, selling and renting some digital equipment related products. She hopes to go to Guangzhou to develop her career.

It's a pity that all this stopped abruptly when she lost her life forever in a car accident.

May she still have the same cheerfulness and passion to do what she want to do in her next world! <sub>[1]</sub>
