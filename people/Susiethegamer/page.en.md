## Memories

Susie was a sweet and cheerful trans girl with a love for *Arknights*, particularly for the character Ch’en the Holungday (whose name she borrowed as Susie Glitter). Her passion for video games inspired her username, *Susiethegamer*.  

She often played games with her elder sister, Lumi Neko-maki. Among her favorites was *The Finals*, although she would occasionally grow dizzy in the 3D environment and switch to playing *Rainbow Six Siege*, a favorite of her sister. In *Siege*, Susie had a charming clumsiness that made her all the more endearing.

After their gaming sessions, the two sisters would often sing *Yorushika* songs together on Discord. Susie adored their music, and despite Lumi’s habit of waking up late, she’d always find Susie waiting for her online.  

Susie had a knack for fashion and a soft spot for Uniqlo clothes. She loved sharing her outfits with her sister, despite playfully describing herself as "a little chubby"—a cuteness that made everyone want to pinch her cheeks. She dreamed of cosplaying Ch’en once she slimmed down.

When asked if she’d prefer studying in the UK or Singapore, she chose Singapore, where her sister was residing.

In 2023, Susie received an offer from a university in the U.S. but couldn’t attend due to her mental health struggles. She later expressed a stronger desire to go to Japan instead.

Susie had long wrestled with severe suicidal thoughts. Though her friends rarely mentioned it openly, they watched over her carefully.

In April 2024, Susie and some friends visited Snowfairy, who was studying at a language school in Japan. Their days together were joyful, filled with laughter.

Yet, beneath her cheerful demeanor, Susie struggled. During the trip, she made a near-tragic attempt to end her life. Snowfairy was desperate to reach her but, hindered by their own fragile state, sought help from friends. Thankfully, Susie survived that moment.

Back in China, Susie frequently spoke of her longing to live and study in Japan. Snowfairy even recommended scenic spots for her to visit. But her mental health soon deteriorated visibly. Multiple attempts to reach out were made, yet the darkness was unyielding.

In her final days, Susie gave away much of her belongings, stopped playing games, and shared a bittersweet post showcasing her treasured collections—perhaps her way of saying goodbye. Her last message was one of farewell.

By the time the authorities arrived, it was too late.

The lively, vibrant Susie from our memories had become a distant echo. Her funeral saw her spirit reduced to a small, cold box.

## Farewell

> *Until we meet again, Susie.*
>
> *一緒に遊ぼう、いつまでも。*

The memories are vivid and heavy—dreams of Susie’s laughter fade into tears. Her wallpaper still flickers on the screen, a cruel reminder of the girl who loved video games but will never return.

No more chats on Discord.
No more games of *Rainbow Six Siege* or *The Finals*.

> *Three souls met by fate, sharing poetry till dawn.*
>
> *Mountains now carry the sorrowful news—one has gone.*
>
> *The promise made at Shinagawa lingers still.*
>
> *May the heavens, in their grace, clear the frost from her path, guiding her to warmth and light.*

That embrace at Shinagawa Station feels like yesterday. The izakaya laughter still echoes, a fleeting dream.

Susie, may your journey now be free from hardship. May your wishes come true in a kinder world.
