## Description

Sakuya had a passion for programming and the web since her childhood. She loved role-playing and simulation games.
She had an interest in game development.
She contributed to the development of many games, including *PokÃ©mon Go* and *The Headmaster*.
Besides being a talented programmer proficient in languages like Java, PHP, and C++, Sakuya was also skilled in stock trading and video editing.
She once founded a translation group.

She started her own fashion company, but it went bankrupt, leading her to lose almost all her income sources.
She wasn't able to make a comeback.
Subsequently, she moved to Shanghai for a while.
During her time in Shanghai, although she often worried about financial issues, she managed to spend her days relatively happily, thanks to the company and support of her friends.

In her will, Sakuya wrote:

Rest well, Sakuya. May you find happiness and peace. Wishing you a smooth journey to the stars.
