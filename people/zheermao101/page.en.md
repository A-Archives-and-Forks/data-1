## Description

Zheermao was a trans girl who was extremely lacking in love and needed care.

Her MBTI personality was INFJ-A/INFJ-T.

She enjoyed songs from *Touhou Project*.

She played various games, such as *Plague Inc.*, *Overwatch*, and *Needy Streamer Overload*.

She also loved galgames.
While playing *Mystery Lover 2*, she thought about many of her own experiences...

Zheermao was quite knowledgeable about digital products. She once shared her insights on related topics on Zhihu.

Occasionally, she would visit the local library in Xi'an to read her favourite books.

## Departure

As mentioned in the her description,
Zheermao was a girl extremely deprived of love.
She always relied on friends around her and often needed their companionship.

[Arts](https://one-among.us/profile/ArtsEpiphany) once sent Fold-eared Cat a caring letter.
They had a good relationship, and Zheermao kept Arts's letter all along.

Zheermao attempted to leave this world several times but survived with difficulty through rescues.

However, in the early spring of 2024,
following the death of a friend, she made up her mind to leave again.

A few days before her departure,
she sent an email to One Among Us.
Upon seeing it, one member sent her a reply overnight:

]} />

Later, that member contacted her on Telegram and tried to comfort her, then talked with her for a long time about transgender experiences, love and being loved, and the meaning of living, trying to keep her for a little longer.

Despite this, she still insisted on her decision... and ultimately chose to leave.

After her departure, Han Lianyi wrote an [epitaph](https://t.me/Lianyi520/565) for her.

Perhaps Zheermao's departure was not an unexpected ending.

But now, everything can only be turned into a long sigh...
