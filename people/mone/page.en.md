## Description

Mone is a cisgender ally among us. She's a cute little girl.

She loves idol groups and singing tv programmes in Japan and South Korea, and often reposts their tweets.

She also plays Minecraft. In that game, she built a small villa with a cozy room belonging to herself.

According to Mone, she never got happiness and love. Her parents got divorced in the first half of 2023. After that, she lived with her mother. The lack of love from family made her depressed. During the past 7 months, her father always refused to visit her, and her paternal grandmother didn't care about her any more. She was treated for depression in hospital. It was a period she missed, because she received lots of love from other patients:

> You should live better, you are not burden of your mother.
>
> You are so lovely, I think. Do not feel inferior or blame yourself anymore.
>
> I feel you are so lovely, very beautiful, sensible and tough. It's quite difficult to weather these things.
>
> You are a sweet child, tell me when you are in trouble. Be chuffed! (Smile)
>
> Sweet sister, from now on, we together, seek happy life, after this, we together, seek and quest, we together, discharge and recover! Don't worry, I will back you.
>
> You are lovely and you have honesty.
>
> You are lovely and sensitive. Other's disfortune and yourself are not interrelated. You can be more selfish, love yourself better and care more about yourself.
>
> May you happy every day! (Cat Emoji)
>
> Live better, love yourself further.

She was very fond of her little brother. Days before her birthday, her father finally visited her with her little brother briefly, and she had a jolly time with little brother. But after their leaving, huge gap between afterglow and reality made her sadly again, and her depression and self-reproach got even worse.

Much as she was in major depressive disorder, she still shared her daily life happily to us, and comforted herself by watching beautiful sunset and perfumed flowers.

Before Mone chose to depart, she left a cute picture to express that she was fond of all of us.

Goodnight, Mone. May you get more care and warm hugs, and be a light-hearted girl.
