## Description

When people talk about lxy,
they often described her as a kind-hearted and thoughtful person,
always putting others first.  

She was constantly looking for ways to help others,
thinking, “Compared to some, I’m already quite fortunate.”
And with that thought, she’d quietly watch her friends grow and improve bit by bit.  

Lxy was an avid fan of W-chan from *Arknights*, using her as an avatar across many platforms.
Skilled in multiple programming languages,
she enjoyed creating interesting projects—like frameworks for DingTalk mini-apps, code for running DingTalk bots, and a customisable DG-LAB plugin for VSCode.
She also set up a *Minecraft* server (Lxycraft), a small but cosy haven where her friends could gather.  

Even though she humbly described her skills in various programming languages as “average” on her profile, everyone agreed that she was truly brilliant.

There were countless things about her that left a lasting impression on those who knew her.  

## Her Departure  

Lxy’s sudden departure was a tremendous shock to her friends.

She left behind only a few words, but they were filled with warmth and care for those around her.  

Family conflicts and years of depression and anxiety took a heavy toll on her.
She had placed her last hope in therapy,
but her psychologist couldn’t provide the support she needed—beyond medication,
the counselling itself didn’t make a difference.  

As one chat record suggested,
perhaps in the end,
she could only rely on her own salvation to love herself and finding the strength to keep going.  

She gave all her love and kindness to others, but left none for herself.

## Some Memories of Her Friend

AloneStar bid farewell to her with a playthrough of *Arcaea*'s *Last | Moment*.

During the gameplay, they triggered a <span style="color: #f38ba8; font-weight: bold;">Lost</span> and a <span style="color: #fe640b; font-weight: bold;">Far</span> with intent —— the <span style="color: #f38ba8; font-weight: bold;">Lost</span> symbolising her absence, and the <span style="color: #fe640b; font-weight: bold;">Far</span> representing the lingering regrets between them.
